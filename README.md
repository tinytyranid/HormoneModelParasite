# The Stochasitc Hormone Model with parasites

The Hormone Model is part of the AHA project (https://ahamodel.uib.no).

A model description of the Hormone model with a stochastic encironemnt is published in Oikos: https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.07483 (Jensen et al. 2020), while the model description for the base model is published in Biology Open: https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.046144 (Weidner et al. 2020).

The main difference between the base and stochastic model versions is the addition of a stochastic environment, that varies gradually over time in an autocorrelated manner. We use an autocorrelated process modified from Ripa and Lundberg (1996; https://www.jstor.org/stable/50667).

In this version of the Hormone model we also include a simple parasite that only extract an energic cost from the host.
